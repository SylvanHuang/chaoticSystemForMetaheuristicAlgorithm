Continuous Time Chaotic Systems for  Meta-heuristic Algorithms

This repository contains code and data for the study named "Continuous Time Chaotic Systems for Meta-heuristic Algorithms"and contains one of xls file and two of m files. 

Xls file contains test results for Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Chaotic Systems.
M files contains code of used chaotic systems and generates random numbers.


This study is under review yet, therefore full text not given
