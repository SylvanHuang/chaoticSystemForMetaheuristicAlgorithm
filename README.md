Continuous Time Chaotic Systems for  Meta-heuristic Algorithms
This repository contains code and data for the study named "Continuous Time Chaotic Systems for Meta-heuristic Algorithms".

Contains one of xls file and two of m files. 
Xls file contains test results for Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Chaotic Systems
m files contains code of used chaotic systems and generates random numbers

You can access the WOA via http://www.alimirjalili.com/WOA.html 

This study is under review yet, therefore full text not given
